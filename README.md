 Hi, I’m @shivaravi88
 I’m interested in coding, problem-solving, and software development.
 I’m currently learning C++ and Python.
 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, competitive programming, and interesting coding challenges.
 How to reach me: You can connect with me via email at [kethavathshiva14@gmail.com].
 Pronouns: He/Him.
 Fun fact: I love debugging as much as coding—it’s like solving a puzzle!
